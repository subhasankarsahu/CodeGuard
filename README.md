# CodeSift AI

> **AI-Powered Code Security for Modern Teams**

CodeSift AI is an autonomous DevSecOps SaaS platform that helps developers detect security vulnerabilities, code-quality issues, and risky changes in GitHub pull requests, understand the risks, and safely fix them.

## What CodeSift AI Does

CodeSift AI connects repositories, receives webhook events, analyzes code changes, stores findings, and surfaces actionable review output in a dashboard.

Core outcomes:

- Detect security, bug, performance, and maintainability risks in PR/MR changes.
- Enforce organization-specific rules from `.codeguard.yml` (Policy-as-Prompt).
- Generate optional AI-assisted fix PRs/MRs with safety checks.
- Expose taint-propagation views for cross-file risk paths and semantic flow.
- Track review history, risk trends, and downloadable reports.

## Feature Coverage

### 1) AI Review Pipeline

- GPT-4o diff analysis with typed/validated review responses.
- Categorized findings (`bug`, `security`, `performance`, `readability`, `maintainability`).
- Risk scoring and summary generation per review.
- Comment posting to source control and dashboard-level history.

### 2) Policy-as-Prompt (`.codeguard.yml`)

- Fetches `.codeguard.yml` from repository root at PR head SHA.
- YAML parsing + strict schema validation (`js-yaml` + `zod`).
- Injects validated policy rules into dedicated GPT-4o policy enforcement prompt.
- Persists policy definitions and per-review policy violations.
- UI support:
  - Policy tab on review detail
  - Policy viewer and enforcement toggle on repositories page
- New APIs:
  - `GET /api/policy/:repositoryId`
  - `GET /api/policy/violations/:reviewId`
  - `PUT /api/policy/:repositoryId/toggle`

Specification doc: [docs/codeguard-yml-spec.md](docs/codeguard-yml-spec.md)

### 3) Cross-File Taint Analysis

- Graph construction and taint path propagation for changed code scope.
- Optional AI enrichment for explanation/fix context.
- Persisted graph + path artifacts with dedicated endpoints.
- UI support:
  - Taint Paths tab
  - Semantic Graph tab

### 4) AI Auto-Fix Workflow

- Trigger fix from actionable review comments.
- Retrieves file context, generates full-file fix, creates branch and PR/MR.
- Includes safety blocks for sensitive file families.
- Presents progress flow in UI and links back to created PR/MR.

### 5) Developer UX Enhancements

- Security-fix indicator badges (icon-based, emoji-free).
- Reviews page advanced filtering:
  - risk
  - status
  - platform
  - review type (security fix vs regular)
  - sorting + reset filters
- Legal pages updated with detailed terms/privacy language aligned to platform behavior.
- Settings page refactor with better reliability:
  - query-driven loading
  - dirty-state tracking
  - reset/save controls
  - clearer webhook/security guidance

### 6) Admin & Operations

- Comprehensive Admin Overview dashboard tracking Users, Audits, API Cost, and User Feedback.
- Free Audit Queue management to review and approve public requests.
- Dynamic Promo Offer Campaign Settings to easily manage start/end dates for promotional campaigns.

## Security Hardening Implemented

CodeGuard now includes stronger production safeguards:

- Session secret enforcement in production (`SESSION_SECRET` required, min length policy).
- Sanitized `/api/user` response (no token exposure).
- CSRF protection for state-changing API routes (with defined exemptions).
- Mandatory GitHub webhook signature validation when processing repository webhooks.
- Repository identity checks on webhook payloads.
- Redacted API response logging for sensitive keys.
- Stronger CORS handling with `APP_ORIGIN` allowlist in production.
- Production CSP tightened (notably removing `unsafe-eval`).
- Safe external URL handling in frontend for PR/MR links.
- Masked webhook secrets in UI (explicit reveal/copy flow).
- Incident-response guidance and secure env template:
  - [.env.example](.env.example)
  - [docs/SECURITY_INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md](docs/SECURITY_INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md)

## Project Structure

| Path | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `client/` | Frontend app (dashboard, reviews, settings, policy/taint views) |
| `server/` | API routes, auth, integrations, AI orchestration, taint + policy engines |
| `shared/` | Shared schema/types (Drizzle + Zod) |
| `api/` | Serverless entry wiring |
| `script/`, `scripts/` | Build and utility scripts |
| `docs/` | Product/docs specs (including `.codeguard.yml` spec and incident response) |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL database
- OpenAI API key
- GitHub OAuth app credentials

### Environment Setup

Use [.env.example](.env.example) as your baseline.

Minimum local variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/codeguard
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:5000/auth/github/callback
SESSION_SECRET=your_long_random_secret_min_32_chars
APP_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5000
```

Optional:

```env
TAINT_ENGINE_ENABLED=true
ENABLE_DEBUG_GITHUB_AUTH=false
```

### Install and Run

```bash
npm install
npm run db:push
npm run dev
```

### Build and Start

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Deployment Checklist

Before production release:

1. Set strong `SESSION_SECRET` and valid `APP_ORIGIN`.
2. Rotate any previously exposed secrets/tokens.
3. Ensure repository webhook secrets are configured.
4. Run type check: `npm run check`.
5. Verify webhook signature failures are rejected.
6. Verify `/api/user` does not expose token fields.
7. Ensure CI workflow is active (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## CI and Quality Gates

Current CI workflow includes:

- install dependencies
- typecheck
- dependency audit (high severity and above)

Path: [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)

## Notes on GitLab

GitHub webhook flow is the primary production path. GitLab helper logic exists in code for parts of the fix flow, while webhook parity is still evolving.
